## Credits

I have used ChatGPT to help me comment the finished code in a way that is professional, while I am still learning best practice on commenting. 
I have used ChatGPT to help me understand some JavaScript concepts as I progressed through the challenge, but a big effort has been made on keeping the code solutions original/my own.
